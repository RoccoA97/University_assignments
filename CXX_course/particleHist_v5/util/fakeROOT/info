The package simulate the ROOT behaviour for the minimal istructions used 
in the examples with TH1F and TFile objects, for machines where ROOT 
is not available. 
Histograms can be saved to a binary file and later dumped to screen and/or 
converted to ROOT file by tools provided in the package.

*** Install and compile ***

After unpacking the util.tgz file in a directory ..., simply run the script
.../util/fakeROOT/install
The full path must be used, issuing the simple command "install"
after setting the current directory at /util/fakeROOT does not work,
even if the "." is included in the path list.

*** Usage ***

After installation, the ROOTSYS environment variable can be set to refer 
to the fakeROOT package issuing the command
. .../util/fakeROOT/envset.sh
or
source .../util/fakeROOT/envset.csh
for Bourne-shell or C-shell respectively.

This should be not executed when ROOT is available, to avoid conflicts; 
${ROOTSYS}/bin can be added to the PATH and ${ROOTSYS}/lib must be 
added to the LD_LIBRARY_PATH .

The code compiling with ROOT should compile the same way, if no other 
ROOT functionality than the ones described with the examples are used 
and the fakeROOT/bin/root-config script is used. 

*** Dump and conversion of histograms ***

When histograms have been written to a hist.fake file, they can be dump 
to the screen issuing the command
.../util/fakeROOT/bin/dumpHisto hist.fake
and giving the name of the histogram to dump.

The binary file can be copied to a machine where ROOT is available; 
after installing the fakeROOT package as described before all the histogram 
in the hist.fake file can be converted to ROOT format and saved into hist.root 
file issuing the command
.../util/fakeROOT/bin/recoverHisto hist.fake hist.root
