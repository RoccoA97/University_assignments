Three classes are provided, to generate random numbers with flat or gaussian 
distribution:
- in "base" there's a base    class with a random generator based on stdlib,
- in "root" there's a derived class with a random generator based on ROOT.

*** Compile ***

cd ..../util/src/random/base
source compile
cd ..../util/src/random/root
source compile

*** Test ***

cd ..../util/src/random/base
source compileRandom
source compileRootRandom

testRandom N p X Y
testRootRandom N p X Y
where
N     = number of events to generate
p X Y = f L H (for flat     distribution, with L and H lower and higher bounds)
p X Y = g M S (for gaussian distribution, with M and S mean  and sigma)

*** Use ***

Compile including only "..../util/include/Random.h" and link
"..../util/lib/librandom.so" (always) and
"..../util/lib/librandom_root.so" (to use the ROOT random generator).
The ROOT random generator will be automatically used if the librandom_root
library is linked, otherwise the stdlib random generator will be used.

At the beginning of each session, for csh:
setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH ${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}":..../util/lib"
or, for bash
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}":..../util/lib"
