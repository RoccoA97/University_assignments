# Python Data Analysis Notebooks
This is a repository containing all the given exercises for the course **Laboratory of Computational Physics (mod. A)**, attended in 2019/20 a.y. at University of Padua.

The aim of these notebooks is to introduce and guide students through the world of data analysis with python, facing problems concerning:
* data handling;
* data visualization;
* algorithms;
* Monte Carlo methods;
* a lot of other stuff.



## Content
Content of the notebooks:
* **Ex00**, **Ex01**, **Ex02**: Introduction, Fundamentals and Number Representation;
* **Ex03**: Numpy for generic computational problems;
* **Ex04**, Ex05: Data handling with Pandas;
* **Ex06**: Visualization exercises with Matplotlib;
* **Ex07.1**, **Ex07.2**: Algorithms, with the application of modules like Numpy, Scipy, Matplotlib.
* **Ex08**: Monte Carlo techniques applied to computational exercises;
* **Ex09**: introduction to Numba and parallel computing fundamentals.
