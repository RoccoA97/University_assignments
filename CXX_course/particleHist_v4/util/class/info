Two utilities are provided:
- a program "createClass" to create the skeleton of a class
- a C-shell script "cloneClass" to create a copy of an existing class 
  with a new name and the same functions

*** Compile ***

c++ -Wall -o createClass createClass.cc

*** Create a new class ***

createClass CLASSNAME [type1 func1 [type2 func2 [...]]]

e.g to create the skeleton of a class with name "Vector2D" and 
functions "float getX()" and "float getY()" issue the command

createClass Vector2D float getX float getY

Two files Vector2D.h and Vector2D.cc are created; they can be edited 
to add any parameter to the function(s) or modify anything else

*** Clone a class ***

cloneClass OLDNAME NEWNAME

e.g. to create a Vector3D class as a copy of Vector2D with the same 
functions issue the command

cloneClass Vector2D Vector3D

Two files Vector3D.h and Vector3D.cc are created; they're identical 
to Vector2D.h and Vector2D.cc with "Vector2D" replaced by "Vector3D" 
everywhere.
